# Status - WIP
**This is work in progress!**

# Setup, Requirements & Install

"ootstra" is inspired by [Bigfork's quickstart recipe](https://github.com/bigfork/silverstripe-recipe) for [Silverstripe](https://www.silverstripe.org/). It's an opinionated set of tools for a ready to run, build & deploy a CMS instance. To get it up and running you'll need [GIT](https://git-scm.com/), an editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended) & [ddev](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). It utilizes [dnadesign/silverstripe-elemental](https://github.com/dnadesign/silverstripe-elemental) for a block/element based CMS experience and comes with the following set of elements:

- ElementContent
- ElementForm               (userforms)
- ElementVirtual
- ElementHero               (Slider, YouTube Video)
- ElementMaps               (Google)
- ElementPerso              (URLs Perso, vCard)
- ElementPersoCFA           (linked persos)
- ElementContentSection     (accordion with FAQ schema)
- ElementCounter
- ElementLogo               (partner/sponsor)
- ElementGallery            (lightbox, slider)
- ElementTeaser
- ElementFeedTeaser         (holder concept with multiple parents & filtering per tags)
- ElementTextImage
- ElementPDFDocument        PDF Download with preview & description

Optional, separate modules/elements:
- [InstagramFeed](https://github.com/lerni/instagram-basic-display-feed-element)
- ElementJobs lerni/jobpostings (privat), schema.org & sitemap.xml integration
- lerni/simplebasket (privat), Google Shoppingfeed with local Inventory, swissQR bill and CAMT payment reconciliation or Datatrans Payments

Other features:
- [DSGVO, GDPR, nDSG ready, Cookie Consent with klaro!](https://github.com/lerni/klaro-cookie-consent)
- Multilingual ready in minutes with [fluent](https://github.com/tractorcow-farm/silverstripe-fluent)
- Elemental based [Blog](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-blog)
- [schema.org](https://schema.org/) integration with [spatie/schema-org](https://github.com/spatie/schema-org)
- Meta & OpenGraph integration & MetaOverviewPage
- depending on content close to 100 Google PageSpeed Score
- [Google Analytics & Tagmanager, Microsoft Clarity](https://github.com/lerni/googleanalytics), sitemap.xml, robots.txt
- etc.

## Getting started

### VSCode Configuration
Per `.vscode/extensions.json` extensions will be suggested. `.vscode/settings.json` makes Logviewer work and contains settings for debugging etc.
<!-- - [Silverstripe](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adrianhumphreys.silverstripe)

- [Sass](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=syler.sass-indented)
- [PHP Debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xdebug.php-debug)

### 1. Clone or fork lerni/ootstra
```bash
git clone git@github.com:lerni/ootstra.git "PROJECT"
```
By default folder name is used as project name, which is recommended because `.vscode/launch.json` uses `${workspaceFolderBasename}` and also DDEV uses foldername as default name.

### 2. Set up DDEV environment (Command+Shift+B, ddev start)
```bash
cd "PROJECT"
ddev start
```
### 3. Start DDEV and install dependencies (Command+Shift+B, npm install)
```bash
ddev composer install
```
### 4. Build the database (Command+Shift+B, dev/build)
On dev/build database structure will be generated. With fluent (Multilingual-Setup) commented-out locale setting, as fluent will handle language configuration.
```php
i18n::set_locale('de_CH');
```
```bash
ddev sake dev/build
```
### 5. Populate default content
```bash
ddev sake dev/tasks/PopulateTask
```

This provides:
- Webserver at [https://PROJECTNAME.ddev.site](https://PROJECTNAME.ddev.site)
- phpMyAdmin at [https://PROJECTNAME.ddev.site:8037](https://PROJECTNAME.ddev.site:8037)
- Mailpit at [https://PROJECTNAME.ddev.site:8026/](https://PROJECTNAME.ddev.site:8026/)

Default CMS-Login at [/admin](https://PROJECTNAME.ddev.site/admin) is `admin` & `password`.

### ssh forwarding, ddev-ssh-agent
This setup omits `ddev-ssh-agent` and exposes `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` from the host system into the web container in order to use local SSH keys. To make that work, key files from `~/.ssh` or the whole directories must be exposed into ddev by creating symlinks in `~/.ddev/homeadditions`. On macOS, the option `IgnoreUnknown UseKeychain` in `~/.ssh/config` causes `Bad configuration option` in the container, so symlinking individual files from `~/.ssh/` into `~/.ddev/homeadditions` and having a separate/copy of `~/.ddev/homeadditions/.ssh/config` worked for me ;)
For more information, refer to the [ddev documentation](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extend/in-container-configuration/) & [OpenSSH updates in macOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2449/_index.html), [DDEV issue](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/issues/1904)
```bash
UserKnownHostsFile=~/.ssh/known_hosts
StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new
Host *
    ForwardAgent yes
```
To use `ddev-ssh-agent` instead, following configuration in `.ddev/config.yaml` can be removed and `.ddev/docker-compose.ssh-agent.yaml` can be deleted.
```yaml
omit_containers: [ddev-ssh-agent]
webimage_extra_packages: [openssh-client]
web_environment:
    - SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/run/host-services/ssh-auth.sock
```

### npm, Laravel Mix watch & build etc.
[Laravel Mix](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix) ([webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) based) is used as build environment. You need to run `ddev theme install` to install npm packages. Watcher browsersync/reload can be started with `ddev theme watch` and will be available at [https://PROJECTNAME.ddev.site:3000/](https://PROJECTNAME.ddev.site:3000/). A production build can be done with `ddev theme prod`. See also scripts section in `themes/default/package.json` and [Mix CLI](https://laravel-mix.com/docs/6.0/cli).

### VSCode tasks - remember all the commands :information_desk_person:
There are a bunch of tasks in `.vscode/tasks.json` available per `Command+Shift+B`:
- `ddev start` (magenta)
- `ddev stop` (magenta)
- `ddev restart` (magenta)
- `composer install` (magenta)
- `composer update` (magenta)
- `ddev log web` (magenta)
- `xdebug on / off` (magenta)
- `ddev theme install` (green)
- `ddev theme watch` (green)
- `ddev theme prod` (green)
- `dev/build` (blue) instead of `ddev php ./vendor/silverstripe/framework/cli-script.php dev/build flush`
- `composer vendor-expose` (blue)
- `ssshell` (blue) instead of `ddev php ./vendor/bin/ssshell`
- `download database from live` (cyan)
- `download assets from live` (cyan)
- `ssh test / live` (cyan)
- `deploy test / live` (cyan)
- `deploy:unlock test / live` (cyan)
- `dep releases test / live` (cyan)

Colors group tasks like:
- magenta: local ddev
- blue: local silverstripe specific
- green: local npm
- cyan: remote server

Database, credentials etc. are provided as environment-variables from `.ddev/config.yaml` and are populated in `/.env` during DDEV-start. Project specific / sensitive env-vars should be set in `/.env` and won't land in GIT. For example you do not have to setup DB credentials for dev environment to work, but you need to set `APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY`, `SS_NOCAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` & `SS_NOCAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY` in `.env` to make Google Maps & reCaptcha work.

## PHP Version
Current used PHP-Version is 8.3. It's set in following places:
- `.ddev/config.yaml`
- `deploy/config.php`
- `public/.htaccess` -> watch out if stage specific versions are maintained in `deploy/`
- `composer.json`
- `.vscode/settings.json`

Don't forget to `ddev restart` and update packages `ddev composer u` after changing!

# Hosting & Deployment

Deployment is based on [Deployer](https://deployer.org/), a php based cli-tool, which is included as dev-requirement per `composer.json`. It uses symlinks to the current release. It's easy to use, offers zero downtime deployments and rollback. `public/assets`, `.env` are shared resources, this means they are symlinked into each release-folder. On remote servers you'll need [SSH](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) & git, composer, same php-version on CLI as httpd, ln, readlink, realpath, rsync, sed & xargs.

```

## SSH Key Setup
Public SSH keys [must be added to the remote servers](https://www.google.com/search?q=add+public+key+to+server) in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. On nix-based systems, use [ssh-copy-id](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/copy-id).

## Configuration
Rename `deploy/config.example.php` to `deploy/config.php` and configure as needed. The `.htaccess` file in `/public` is typically used, but can be overridden with stage-specific versions by creating `./deploy/test.htaccess` or `./deploy/live.htaccess`.

# Deploy
Key-forwarding is used, allowing deployment to be done from inside the ddev-web container. Read [ddev-ssh-agent](#ssh-forwarding-ddev-ssh-agent) above. Before first deployment, SSH into remote servers like `ddev php ./vendor/bin/dep ssh test` or `ddev php ./vendor/bin/dep ssh live` and ensure the SSH fingerprint from the git-repo is accepted. You can check like `ssh -T git@bitbucket.org` or may just `git clone ...` into a test directory to verify everything works as expected. If so, deployment is done as follows:

```bash
    ddev php ./vendor/bin/dep deploy test
```

or

```bash
    ddev php ./vendor/bin/dep deploy live
```
The first deployment to each stage will prompt for database credentials to populate an `.env` file. The resulting file will be similar to:
```
# For a complete list of core environment variables see
# https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/5/getting_started/environment_management/#core-environment-variables

# reCAPTCHA key from: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create
# SS_NOCAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=''
# SS_NOCAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=''

SCRIPT_FILENAME=''
```
## Mailer Setup
Without setting `MAILER_DSN`, `sendmail` is used by default, typically using `SS_ADMIN_EMAIL` as sender. To use SMTP or other mailers, the `MAILER_DSN` variable should be set in the `.env`. When `MAILER_DSN` is configured, setting `SS_SEND_ALL_EMAILS_FROM` may also be appropriate. Silverstripe utilizes [Symfony Mailer](https://symfony.com/doc/current/mailer.html), which supports a variety of transport methods. With `php ./vendor/silverstripe/framework/cli-script.php dev/tasks/test-email-task to=user@domain.tld` a Test-Mail can be sent. Be aware, usually Mailpit catches all emails for local development with DDEV.

## Deploy a branch/tag/revision

```
# Deploy revision (git SHA) to test
ddev php ./vendor/bin/dep deploy --revision=ca5fcd330910234f63bf7d5417ab6835e5a57b81 test

# Deploy dev branch to test
ddev php ./vendor/bin/dep deploy --branch=dev test

# Deploy tag 1.0.1 to live
ddev php ./vendor/bin/dep deploy live --tag=1.0.1 live
```

## Show deployed revision
```bash
ddev php ./vendor/bin/dep releases live
